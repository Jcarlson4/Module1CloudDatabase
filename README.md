# Module1CloudDatabase
A Firestore Database.



# Overview

During this project, I was able to watch several videos and check out multiple resources to learn how to use a NO-SQL database. I also learned about how a cloud database works and to further my knowledge in it's syntax.

The redstore database is a google hosted database that is hosted on the cloud. This example was created to store data from a recent tournament that I had with a group of friends playing a minature game called Star Wars legion. This is the beggining stages of the database. The software has code for inserting data, reading data, using queries and setting up and using the database useing python.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running, a walkthrough of the code, and a view of the cloud database.}

# Cloud Database

The database that I used was Firestore. It is a free NO-SQL database that is hosted by google. It is very user friendly and helps you get started in creating your own web apps , applications , etc.

To follow along with the idea of having a database host the data for a legion tournament, I started a collection with the players. Within the collection, it has documents of each and every player that was in the tournament. Each document then has data about the player, their firstname, lastname and faction that they played.

# Development Environment

For developing the software i used python to be able to write the insert, delete, update and queries for the database. I also used python modules to be able to connect and write code for the database.
